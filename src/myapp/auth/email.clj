(ns myapp.auth.email
  "SMTP email delivery for magic link authentication.
  Uses Jakarta Mail directly (via Eclipse Angus) — no wrapper library.

  Two hazards shape this namespace, both learned from the resilience audit:

  1. The relay is a dependency that can be *slow*, not just down. Jakarta's
     socket timeouts default to INFINITE, so a relay that completes the TCP
     handshake but then stalls would pin the caller forever. `smtp-session`
     sets finite connect/read/write timeouts so a stall is bounded.
  2. Login IS email, and the send used to run inline on the http-kit worker
     thread — so a stalled relay would starve the request pool and take
     `/health` (same pool) down with it, a one-dependency total outage. The
     send now runs on a small BOUNDED background mailer (`deliver-magic-link!`);
     the request thread never blocks on the relay, and a relay outage backs
     up against a bounded queue (backpressure) instead of the whole box."

  fails fast and is caught, rather than parking a mailer thread forever."
